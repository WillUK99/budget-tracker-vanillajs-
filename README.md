### About.
I created this as a wanted to test my javascript skills and create something that has real world use for myself. This project has so far been the hardest for myself as I tried many different ways to make a budget app and after much time learning I decided to go with the approach I have gone with in the above files. I saw the design/layout from a stackoverflow QnA and decided to replicate it. 

The main issues I had whilst creating this project was figuring out how to edit a income or payments info and then also refresh to total budget.
